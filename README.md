# **RetroBridge Advanced Mode**

## Description
**Advanced Mode** offers a robust solution for users to perform seamless transfers from a single source network address to multiple destination networks and addresses. 
This feature operates without the utilization of smart contracts and is based on a direct transfer function. Users send funds to our concentrated liquidity on the source chain, after which we validate the transaction and distribute the users assets to the specified networks and addresses from our hot wallets on each chain.<br /><br />

Utilizing the transfer function, which is among the most cost-effective operations on the blockchain, helps to keep transaction fees low.

## **Execution Modes**
### **Fast Mode**
This mode executes multiple bridging orders rapidly, processing up to 50 bridges within a span of 5-10 minutes.

Due to the high load this mode imposes on our infrastructure, an additional fee may be applied.

### **Sequence Mode**
In Sequence Mode, multiple bridging orders are executed with intervals ranging from 5-15 minutes between each, thereby reducing the load on our infrastructure and avoiding performance bottlenecks.
